I am a graduate student supervised by [Prof. Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml/) in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My research interests lie in reinforcement learning, information retrieval and natural language processing, particularly in text generation.
